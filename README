Test repository for the CEP-Flink-Project of University of Potsdam

To package your job for submission to Flink, use: 'gradle clean && gradle shadowJar'.
Afterwards, you'll find the jar to use in the 'build/libs' folder.

To activate the docker network use:
'docker compose -f zk-single-kafka-single-flink.yml up -d' in this projects directory

This will create a network with containers running: Kafka/Zookeeper, Flink Taskmanager
and Flink Jobmanager. The kafka topics necessary for the application are created
automatically.

To deactivate the network use:
'docker compose -f zk-single-kafka-single-flink.yml down -v' in this projects directory

You can configure the global variables of the application in the Settings.java class.
The Flink-query itself should be written in the DataStreamJob.java class
